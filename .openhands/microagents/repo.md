# Repository Guidelines

## Output Style
- Output should be simple and focused only on generating the final deliverable
- Do not generate documentation about execution processes unless specifically requested
- Avoid creating unnecessary documentation for each step

## Feature Development Approach
- When creating new features, don't try to forcibly preserve existing functionality
- Remove features that are no longer needed
- Prioritize clean implementation over maintaining legacy code
